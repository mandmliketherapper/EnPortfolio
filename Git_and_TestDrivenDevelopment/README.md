## Git Practice

The submodule contained in this folder is a project done in practice for keeping good practice in code quality, such as descriptive comments, verbose variable names, using basic principles of OOP,
and making use of test driven development to develop a faux banking app. Because of the code's simplicity, no pull requests were used, through appropriate branching strategies and use of the project board were 
practiced to help develop skill with version control. A more detailed description of the project can be found in the README of the project's main branch.
